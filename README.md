Thank you for joining us for our first Hackathon event and congratulations for winning a place in our ballot.  
 
## Purpose 
As a community of data scientists and transport enthusiasts, we're here to explore the data, expose new insights and have fun! 
In the past, we have held a series of conferences with the Data Science in Transport community, but are interested in more interactive engagements. With this Hackathon, we are exploring how to achieve this and aim to understand the appetite for such events in this community. As this is our pilot event, we welcome and encourage feedback.  
For this Hackathon, we’re investigating train signal connectivity data as the Department for Transport (DfT) have an interest in ensuring better mobile and Wi-Fi connectivity for rail passengers. 

   
## Essentials 
To join our hackathon, we have specified that you must; 
- Bring your own laptop and charger.
- Have the appropriate coding software installed.
- If you want to use the optional additional data, you must sign the NDA from the data provider. This is not public data and should not be published or shared further. 
 
 
## Data 
For the challenges in the hackathon, we will be making use of the following data:

|Data name| Link|
|---------|-----:|
|OFCOM connected nations:| [See Here](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/multi-sector-research/infrastructure-research/connected-nations-2019/data-downloads)|
|ONS population data:| [See Here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration) OR [LA Mid-year population estimates](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland)|
|Open Street Map Rail lines:| [See Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9wh8b8jp88yb6gy/OSM_rail_lines_GB.geojson?dl=0) or [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ugxe5dseyxuwwjg/OSM_RailLines.shp?dl=0)|
|DfT Rail crowding statistics:| [See Here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/rail-passenger-numbers-and-crowding-on-weekdays-in-major-cities-in-england-and-wales-2018)|
|OS Terrain data:| [See Here](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/terrain-50)|

## Additional data 
We will have some additional data that we will make available to participants on the day.  
This data is optional and you do not need to use this for the hackathon. The data will be explained in the opening talk.  
- As this is unpublished data, the data provider requires a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).  
- Participants will only gain access to the data on condition of signing and agreeing to the terms outlined in the NDA. 

 
## Challenges 
We have produced a set of challenges to start off your explorations in the hackathon. Though this is not an exhaustive list and you are welcome to add your own. The challenges include: 

#### Using published sources: 
1. Which mainline stations have best/worst mobile connectivity and how does that relate to rail crowding statistics? 
2. Where are the greatest blackspots that need further investigation so that we can focus our resources? 
3. In poorly connected areas, are there infrastructure or terrains nearby that may be impacting on performance? If so, how severely? 
 
#### Including optional additional data: 
- Note that you will need to sign an NDA to use this data. 
4. What is the relationship between 4G signal strength as measured by the yellow trains versus people travelling on the train? How does this vary by time of day, location etc. This will help us better understand the passenger experience. 
5. What is the relationship between local population density and people’s experience with signal strength (dBm) / throughput (Mbps)? i.e. if the mobile mast is targeted at a small town then when a large train passes through does everyone suffer? How wide spread is this by geography and time of day? 
6. What can we see in the signal strength data by time of day? 
 


## Licencing 
If you have only used open data, you are free to publish as you like. We recommend GitHub’s Standard MIT licence for sharing.  
However, if you’ve used the additional data, you must adhere to the conditions of the NDA as specified by the data providers. Mainly, this data and derived outputs are not for wider sharing or publication. 


## Coding advice 
There will be multiple members of the DfT team available to provide you with advice on the day. But for beginners, we have assembled some cheat sheets from various sources (attributes included in the PDFs). You can view these [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h7vfwdcxcg59eae/AABXu7SSIZ2SoXCba5-TWu0Pa?dl=0) and use them at your leisure. 


## After the hack 
- During the conference following our hackathon, we have set aside a 15 minute section for talks. In this, you will have the opportunity to do a short 2-3 minute ‘lightning talk’ to our conference attendees. 
Please let us know if you are keen to do this as we would love to hear the interesting ways you have been tackling the challenges.  
- There will be opportunity for some participants to present back to the policy team. We will ask participants to let us know if they are interested in this during the hackathon's closing session. 
- You  can only publish / share work that uses published data. If you've used any data protected by an NDA then you need to follow NDA guidance. If in any doubt whatsoever, please contact the DSIT organising team.
